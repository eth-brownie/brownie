Opens the brownie GUI. Basic functionality is as follows:

 * Selecting an opcode will highlight the associated source code.
 * Highlighting a section of the source will jump to the most relevant opcode,
   if possible.
 * Opcodes with a darkened background have no associated source code.
 * Type a pc number to jump to that opcode.
 * Right click an opcode to toggle highlighting on all opcodes of the same type.
 * Press J to toggle highlighting on JUMP, JUMPI and JUMPDEST opcodes.
 * Press R to toggle highlighting on all REVERT opcodes.
 * Select a section of source code and press S to enter scope mode. The
   instructions will be filtered to only display opcodes related to the relevant
   code. Press A to disable and see all opcodes again.
 * Press C to toggle unit test coverage visualization. This will only work if
   you have already run brownie coverage on your project. The coverage results
   are shown via different colors of text highlight."""
