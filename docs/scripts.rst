Using Scripts to Automate Interactions
======================================

TODO

Brownie lets you run scripts to interact with your project. Scripting is especially useful for deploying your contracts to a persistent network, or for automating processes that you perform regularly.

Every script should begin with ``from brownie import *``. This imports the instantiated project classes into the local namespace and gives access to the :ref:`api` in exactly the same way as if you were using the console.

To execute a script from the command line:

::

    $ brownie run <script> [function]

Or from the console, use the ``run`` method:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> run('token') # executes the main() function within scripts/token.py

Or the import statement:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from scripts.token import main
    >>> main()

Scripts are stored in the ``scripts/`` folder. Each script can contain as many functions as you'd like. If no function name is given, brownie will attempt to run ``main``.

Here is a simple example script from the ``token`` project, used to deploy the ``Token`` contract from ``contracts/Token.sol`` using ``web3.eth.accounts[0]``.

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from brownie import *

    def main():
        accounts[0].deploy(Token, "Test Token", "TEST", 18, "1000 ether")

See the :ref:`api` documentation for available classes and methods when writing scripts.

Unlinked Libraries
==================

If a contract requires a library, the most recently deployed one will be used automatically. If the required library has not been deployed yet an ``UndeployedLibrary`` exception is raised.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> accounts[0].deploy(MetaCoin)
      File "brownie/network/contract.py", line 167, in __call__
        f"Contract requires '{library}' library but it has not been deployed yet"
    UndeployedLibrary: Contract requires 'ConvertLib' library but it has not been deployed yet

    >>> accounts[0].deploy(ConvertLib)
