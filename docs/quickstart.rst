==========
Quickstart
==========

This page will walk you through the basics of using Brownie. Please review the rest of the documentation to learn more about specific functionality.

Installing Brownie
==================

Dependencies
------------

Before installing Brownie, make sure you have the following dependencies:

* `ganache-cli <https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli>`__
* `pip <https://pypi.org/project/pip/>`__
* `python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-368/>`__ version 3.6 or greater, python3-dev

As brownie relies on `py-solc-x <https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/py-solc-x>`__, you do not need solc installed locally but you must install all required `solc dependencies <https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#binary-packages>`__.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install Brownie is via pip.

::

    $ pip install eth-brownie

You can also clone the `github repository <https://github.com/iamdefinitelyahuman/brownie>`__ and use setuptools for the most up-to-date version.

::

    $ python3 setup.py install


Initializing a New Project
==========================

The first step to using Brownie is to initialize a new project. To do this, create an empty folder and then type:

::

    $ brownie init

This will create the following :ref:`project structure<structure>` within the folder:

* ``contracts/``: Contract sources
* ``interfaces/``: Interface sources
* ``scripts/``: Scripts for deployment and interaction
* ``tests/``: Scripts for testing your project
* ``brownie-config.yaml``: Configuration file for the project

You can also initialize "`Brownie mixes <https://github.com/brownie-mix>`__", simple templates to build your project upon. For the examples in this document we will use the `token <https://github.com/brownie-mix/token-mix>`__ mix, which is a very basic ERC-20 implementation:

::

    $ brownie bake token

This creates a new folder ``token/`` and deploys the project inside it.

Compiling your Contracts
========================

To compile your project:

::

    $ brownie compile

You will see the following output:

::

    Brownie v1.0.0 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    Compiling contracts...
    Optimizer: Enabled  Runs: 200
    - Token.sol...
    - SafeMath.sol...
    Brownie project has been compiled at token/build/contracts

Once a contract has been complied, it will only be recompiled if the source file has changed.

You can change the compiler version and optimization settings by editting the :ref:`config file <config-solc>`.

Interacting with your Project
=============================

Brownie provides two ways to interact with your project:

* The **console** is useful for quick testing and debugging as you develop
* Via **scripts** that handle deployments and to automate common tasks

The Console
-----------

The console is an easy to use command-line environment for debugging and testing as you develop. It is almost identical the standard python interpreter. To open it:

::

    $ brownie console

Brownie will compile your contracts, start the local RPC client, and give you a command prompt. From here you may interact with the network with the full range of functionality offered by the :ref:`api`.

.. hint::

    Within the console, the builtin ``dir`` is modified to only display public methods and attributes. It is a valuable tool for exploring Brownie's functionality as you are getting started.

    You can also call ``help`` for detailed information on most objects.

Access to local accounts is through ``accounts``, a list-like object that contains ``Account`` objects capable of making transactions.

Here is an example of checking a balance and transfering some ether:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> accounts[0]
    <Account object '0xC0BcE0346d4d93e30008A1FE83a2Cf8CfB9Ed301'>
    >>> accounts[1].balance()
    100000000000000000000
    >>> accounts[0].transfer(accounts[1], "10 ether")

    Transaction sent: 0x124ba3f9f9e5a8c5e7e559390bebf8dfca998ef32130ddd114b7858f255f6369
    Transaction confirmed - block: 1   gas spent: 21000
    <Transaction object '0x124ba3f9f9e5a8c5e7e559390bebf8dfca998ef32130ddd114b7858f255f6369'>
    >>> accounts[1].balance()
    110000000000000000000

Brownie creates a ``ContractContainer`` object for each contract in your project. They are list-like objects used to deploy new contracts.

Here is an example of deploying a contract:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> Token
    []
    >>> Token.deploy
    <ContractConstructor object 'Token.constructor(string _symbol, string _name, uint256 _decimals, uint256 _totalSupply)'>
    >>> t = Token.deploy("Test Token", "TST", 18, "1000 ether", {'from': accounts[1]})

    Transaction sent: 0x2e3cab83342edda14141714ced002e1326ecd8cded4cd0cf14b2f037b690b976
    Transaction confirmed - block: 1   gas spent: 594186
    Contract deployed at: 0x5419710735c2D6c3e4db8F30EF2d361F70a4b380
    <Token Contract object '0x5419710735c2D6c3e4db8F30EF2d361F70a4b380'>
    >>>
    >>> t
    <Token Contract object '0x5419710735c2D6c3e4db8F30EF2d361F70a4b380'>

When a contact is deployed you are returned a ``Contract`` object that can be used to interact with it. This object is also added to the ``ContractContainer``.

``Contract`` objects contain class methods for performing calls and transactions. In this example we are checking a token balance and transfering tokens:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> t
    <Token Contract object '0x5419710735c2D6c3e4db8F30EF2d361F70a4b380'>
    >>> t.balanceOf(accounts[1])
    1000000000000000000000

    >>> t.transfer
    <ContractTx object 'transfer(address _to, uint256 _value)'>
    >>> t.transfer(accounts[2], "100 ether", {'from': accounts[1]})

    Transaction sent: 0xcd98225a77409b8d81023a3a4be15832e763cd09c74ff431236bfc6d56a74532
    Transaction confirmed - block: 2   gas spent: 51241
    <Transaction object '0xcd98225a77409b8d81023a3a4be15832e763cd09c74ff431236bfc6d56a74532'>
    >>>
    >>> t.balanceOf(accounts[1])
    900000000000000000000
    >>> t.balanceOf(accounts[2])
    100000000000000000000

See :ref:`interaction` for more information on available objects and how they function.

Writing Scripts
---------------

You can write scripts to automate contract deployment and interaction. By placing ``from brownie import *`` at the beginning of your script, you can access objects identically to the way you would in the console.

To execute the ``main`` function in a script, store it in the ``scripts/`` folder and type:

::

    $ brownie run [script name]

Within the token project, you will find an example script at `scripts/token.py <https://github.com/brownie-mix/token-mix/blob/master/scripts/token.py>`__ that is used for deployment:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    from brownie import *

    def main():
        accounts[0].deploy(Token, "Test Token", "TEST", 18, "1000 ether")

Testing your Project
====================

Brownie uses the ``pytest`` framework for contract testing.

Tests should be stored in the ``tests/`` folder.  To run the full suite:

::

    $ brownie test

Brownie provides ``pytest`` fixtures to allow you to interact with your project and to aid in testing. To use a fixture, add an argument with the same name to the inputs of your test function.

Here is an example test function using Brownie fixtures:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    def test_transfer(Token, accounts):
        token = accounts[0].deploy(Token, "Test Token", "TST", 18, "1000 ether")
        assert token.totalSupply() == "1000 ether"
        token.transfer(accounts[1], "0.1 ether", {'from': accounts[0]})
        assert token.balanceOf(accounts[1]) == "0.1 ether"
        assert token.balanceOf(accounts[0]) == "999.9 ether"

Transactions that revert raise a ``VirtualMachineError`` exception. To write assertions around this you can use ``brownie.reverts`` as a context manager, which functions very similarly to ``pytest.raises``:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import brownie

    def test_transferFrom_reverts(Token, accounts):
        token = accounts[0].deploy(Token, "Test Token", "TST", 18, "1000 ether")
        with brownie.reverts():
            token.transferFrom(accounts[0], accounts[3], "10 ether", {'from': accounts[1]})

Test isolation is handled through the ``module_isolation`` and ``fn_isolation`` fixtures:

* ``module_isolation`` resets the local chain before and after completion of the module, ensuring a clean environment for this module and that the results of it will not affect subsequent modules.
* ``fn_isolation`` additionally takes a snapshot of the chain before running each test, and reverts to it when the test completes. This allows you to define a common state for each test, reducing repetitive transactions.

This example uses isolation and a shared setup fixture:

.. code-block:: python
    :linenos:

    import pytest
    from brownie import accounts

    @pytest.fixture(scope="module")
    def token(Token):
        t = accounts[0].deploy(Token, "Test Token", "TST", 18, "1000 ether")
        yield t

    def test_transferFrom(fn_isolation, token):
        token.approve(accounts[1], "6 ether", {'from': accounts[0]})
        token.transferFrom(accounts[0], accounts[2], "5 ether", {'from': accounts[1]})
        assert token.balanceOf(accounts[2]) == "5 ether"
        assert token.balanceOf(accounts[0]) == "995 ether"
        assert token.allowance(accounts[0], accounts[1]) == "1 ether"

    def test_balance_allowance(fn_isolation, token):
        assert token.balanceOf(accounts[0]) == "1000 ether"
        assert token.allowance(accounts[0], accounts[1]) == 0

Brownie monitors which files have changed since the test suite was last executed. Tests that are properly isolated can be skipped if none of the contracts or related test files have changed. To enable this, include the ``--update`` flag.

See :ref:`test` for more information on available fixtures, and other features and options related to unit testing.

Analyzing Test Coverage
=======================

Test coverage is calculated by generating a map of opcodes associated with each statement and branch of the source code, and then analyzing the stack trace of each transaction to see which opcodes executed.

To check test coverage:

::

    $ brownie test --coverage

To view detailed results, first load the Brownie GUI:

::

    $ brownie gui

Next:

    * In the upper-right drop box, select a contract to view.
    * In the drop box immediately left of the contract selection, select "coverage". Then left of that, choose to view either the "statement" or "branch" coverage report.

Relevant code will be highlighted in different colors:

* :green:`Green` code was executed during the tests
* :yellow:`Yellow` branch code executed, but only evaluated truthfully
* :orange:`Orange` branch code executed, but only evaluated falsely
* :red:`Red` code did not execute during the tests

See :ref:`test-coverage` for more information.

Scanning for Security Vulnerabilities
=====================================

To prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced to the code base, Brownie includes a plugin that integrates automated security scans using the `MythX <https://mythx.io/>`_ analysis API. Simply run ``brownie analyze`` on your compiled project directory. This will send the compiled build artifacts to MythX for analysis. By default no login is required and the analysis is going to be executed as a trial user.

To access more vulnerability information, register for free on the MythX website and pass your login data via environment variables or command line arguments.

::

    Brownie v1.0.0 - Python development framework for Ethereum

    Usage: brownie analyze [options] [--async | --interval=<sec>]

    Options:
    --gui                     Launch the Brownie GUI after analysis
    --full                    Perform a full scan (MythX Pro required)
    --interval=<sec>          Result polling interval in seconds [default: 3]
    --async                   Do not poll for results, print job IDs and exit
    --access-token=<string>   The JWT access token from the MythX dashboard
    --eth-address=<string>    The address of your MythX account
    --password=<string>       The password of your MythX account
    --help -h                 Display this message

    Use the "analyze" command to submit your project to the MythX API for
    smart contract security analysis.

    To authenticate with the MythX API, it is recommended that you provide
    the MythX JWT access token. It can be obtained on the MythX dashboard
    site in the profile section. They should be passed through the environment
    variable "MYTHX_ACCESS_TOKEN". If that is not possible, it can also be
    passed explicitly with the respective command line option.

    Alternatively, you have to provide a username/password combination. It
    is recommended to pass them through the environment variables as
    "MYTHX_ETH_ADDRESS" and "MYTHX_PASSWORD".

    You can also choose to not authenticate and submit your analyses as a free
    trial user. No registration required! To see your past analyses, get access
    to deeper vulnerability detection, and a neat dashboard, register at
    https://mythx.io/. Any questions? Hit up dominik.muhs@consensys.net or contact
    us on the website!

Once the analysis is done, the vulnerabilities are stored in the ``reports/`` directory. With ``brownie analyze --gui`` the GUI can be started automatically once the analysis has finished.
